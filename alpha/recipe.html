            A seasonal salad of striped Chioggia beet, juicy orange, and peanuts is a fresh pairing for these zesty quesadillas. We’re seasoning the chicken filling with both jalapeño pepper and Mexican spices—balanced by a layer of melty white cheddar. Mexican crema brightened up with lime juice is perfect for dipping.

                      1. Fill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut out and discard the core of the cabbage; thinly slice the leaves. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.
                    </p>
              </div>
              <div class="step">
                    <p>2. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned shrimp; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until opaque and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate. Set aside in a warm place.
                    </p>
              </div>
              <div class="step">
                    <p>3. Add the sliced cabbage to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. (If the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil.) Cook on mediumhigh, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the verjus and 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any fond, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cabbage has softened and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the plate of cooked shrimp. Wipe out the pan.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <p>4. While the cabbage cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <p>5. While the pasta cooks, in the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until softened and fragrant. Add the tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of water, and as much of the chile paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
